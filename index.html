                <h2>Fox</h2>
                <p>Foxes are mammalian and omnivorous animals belonging to the Canidae family. They are medium-sized
                    vulpids, characterized
                    by a long snout and a long, furry tail.</p>
                <p>They also feature their oval pupils, similar to the vertical pupils of felids.</p>
                <p>Of about 40 species recognized as foxes, only 12 belong to the Vulpes genus of "true foxes", from the
                    which red fox is the most common.</p>
                <p>They also feature their oval pupils, similar to the vertical pupils of felids.</p>

                <h2>Squirrel</h2>
                <p>Squirrels are generally small rodents with slender bodies, bushy tails and large eyes.
                    In general, their fur is short, soft and silky, and ranges in thickness from species to species.</p>
                <p>The color of their fur is also highly variable and can be whitish, gray, yellow, red, brown, or even
                    black.</p>
                <p>It is often assumed that squirrels only eat nuts, but squirrels are actually omnivores, which means
                    they
                    like to eat plants and meat.</p>
                <p>Oftentimes squirrels rely on fungi, seeds, nuts and fruits for nutrition but they will also eat eggs,
                    small insects, caterpillars, small
                    animals and even young snakes. As their food source is highly variable with the weather, squirrels
                    will
                    prepare for colder months, when food is scarce, by burying their food.</p>

                <h2>Bear</h2>
                <p>Bears are large mammals that eat mostly meat and fish. Many bears also eat plants, bulbs, and
                    insects.
                </p>
                <p>Bears have large bodies, stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, paws with claws, and a short tail.
                </p>
                <p>Bears are generally omnivorous, but dietary preferences range from seals for the entirely carnivorous
                    polar
                    bear to assorted vegetation for the largely herbivorous spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus).</p>
                <p>Ursids are mainly animals of northern temperate regions and are found farther north than any other
                    mammal. The Arctic fox is found as far north on land, but the polar bear regularly roams on sea ice
                    hundreds of kilometres from shore.
                    Africa and Australia lack bears entirely. The spectacled bear of South America’s Andes Mountains is
                    the
                    only bear species that lives south of the Equator.</p>

                <h2>Wolf</h2>
                <p>Gray wolves, or timber wolves, are canines with long bushy tails that are often black-tipped. Their
                    coat
                    color is typically a mix of gray and brown with buffy facial markings and undersides, but the color
                    can
                    vary from solid white to brown or black. Gray wolves look somewhat like a large German shepherd.
                </p>
                <p>Wolves vary in size depending on where they live. Wolves in the north are usually larger than those
                    in
                    the south. The average size of a wolf's body is three to five feet long and their tails are usually
                    one
                    to two feet long. Females typically weigh 60 to 100 pounds, and males weigh 70 to 145 pounds.</p>
                <p>Wolves are carnivores—they prefer to eat large hoofed mammals such as deer, elk, bison, and moose.
                    They
                    also hunt smaller mammals such as beavers, rodents, and hares. Adults can eat 20 pounds of meat in a
                    single meal.</p>
                <p>Wolves live in packs. Most packs have four to nine members, but the size can range from as few as two
                    wolves to as many as 15.</p>

                <h2>Monkey</h2>
                <p>Any member of two tropical anthropoid primate groups: Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Almost
                    all
                    species are tropical or subtropical, and almost all are diurnal.</p>
                <p>Most species are arboreal, using all four limbs to leap from tree to tree. They can sit upright and
                    stand
                    erect. Most species run along branches rather than swinging arm over arm like the apes. Monkeys are
                    highly social omnivores, organized in clans as large as several hundred individuals headed by an old
                    male. </p>
                <p>Sexually mature males of all species are always potent, and all nonpregnant females have a monthly
                    menstrual cycle. Most species bear a single young, which is reared by the mother for years</p>
                <p>Monkeys are a large and diverse mammal group that includes most primates.</p>

                <h2>Lion</h2>
                <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing
                    prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond
                    to
                    reddish-brown to black.</p>
                <p>The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. Young lions
                    have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.</p>
                <p>Lions stand between 3.5 and 4 feet (1 and 1.2 meters) tall at the shoulder. Males grow to lengths of
                    10
                    feet (3 meters) and have a 2 to 3 foot (60 to 91 centimeter) tail.</p>
                <p>Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest.</p>
